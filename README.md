# Robot-Drivetrain-With-Good-Mecanum-Placement-And-Accessible-Control-Hubs

This is my fourth version of the drivetrain that I have made during this First Tech Challenge season.
The first one was a simple mecanum strafer chassis from GOBILDA. It was very reliable and easy to build,
however It was very wide, the robot was slow, heavy and it was quite a challenge to mount all of the other
parts on it. Additionally, the wheels were not protected well and it was very challenging to mount the 
odometry pods as there just wasn't enough space. The second drivetrain was the one that I used in my
robot that I built for the Bucharest Twin Cup competition. At first it had many problems as the pulleys
were scraping against the walls of the drivetrain, however after a few iterations it worked just fine.
The only problem was that the mecanum wheels were very close, which lead to our autonomous period not
being as consistent as we would have liked. Then I created a drivetrain with perfect mecanum placement.
It was a lot better in the aspect of the mecanum placement, however because of that it came out a bit
larger than I would have liked and it was very hard to mount anything on it. And the current version is
my last drivetrain. It combines all of the best features from the previous ones as it has odometers 
which are placed on the opposite sides of the robot. Also, due to good motor placement, there is quite
a lot of space in the middle for other mechanisms, however because the next season is not out yet, I have
mounted the control hubs and the battery there. Overall, this was a fun project to design and I can't wait
till I get a chance to go back to our team workshop and make this drivetrain in real life for testing and
hopefully we can use it in the next FTC season.
